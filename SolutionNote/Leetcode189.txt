int[] nums, int k

nums = {a0,a1,a2,a3...aN-1}

we have: rotate(a0,N)  => aN = a0 <=> a0 = a0
 rotate(a0,1)  => a1 = a0

....
=> rotate(ap,k) => a(p+k) = ap   =>  (p+k) mod N = i

(i+k) mod N = j     => i+k              => i + 1k       => 1k
(j+k) mod N = m     => j+k = (i+k)+k    => i + 2k       => 2k
(m+k) mod N = l     => (i+k)+k + k      => i + 3k       => 3k

(t+k) mod N = v                                         => (N-1)k = Nk - k

To prove that (N - i) * k mod N is not equal to (N - j) * k mod N, we can use a proof by contradiction. We assume that the two expressions are equal, and then show that this leads to a contradiction. Here's the step-by-step proof:

1. Assume that (N - i) * k mod N is equal to (N - j) * k mod N.

2. Using the definition of modulo, we can write the equations as follows:
   (N - i) * k ≡ (N - j) * k (mod N)

3. Now, let's isolate the k term by dividing both sides by k. Since k is positive, we can safely do this:
   N - i ≡ N - j (mod N)

4. Next, we want to isolate the i term. To do this, we can subtract N from both sides of the equation:
   -i ≡ -j (mod N)

5. Now, we know that i and j are both less than N, and we have a negative congruence. To simplify things further, we can add N to both sides of the congruence. This won't change the equivalence:
   N - i ≡ N - j (mod N)

6. At this point, we notice that the left-hand side (N - i) is actually equal to the right-hand side (N - j) because we assumed that (N - i) * k mod N is equal to (N - j) * k mod N.

7. Therefore, N - i = N - j.

8. Now, subtract N from both sides again to isolate i:
   -i = -j

9. Finally, divide both sides by -1, but since i and j are both positive integers, this leads to a contradiction. If i = j, then the original assumption (step 1) would be incorrect, which means our assumption was wrong.

Since we've reached a contradiction, our original assumption that (N - i) * k mod N is equal to (N - j) * k mod N must be false. Therefore, we have proven that (N - i) * k mod N is not equal to (N - j) * k mod N when i, k, and N are positive integers, and i and k are less than N.
